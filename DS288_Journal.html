    <h1>DS288 Capstone Weekly Journal</h1>
    <p>
        Maintain a website (e.g., on GitHub, WordPress, Weebly, Wix, etc.) or shared document (e.g., a Google Doc) where each week, you will provide a weekly status 
        report of your project.  A status report shall be one-page max, elaborating on: 
        (1) fails of the week, (2) successes of the week, (3) difficulties of the week, and (4) goals for next week.
    </p>
    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <p>
        For the first week my success was realizing that I probably cannot find the data I need for my original idea of creating an app meant to calm those 
        with health anxiety. From there, I decided to start looking for datasets then build up an idea around a dataset that is useful. My goal for next week is to 
        nail down the exact dataset and capstone idea.
    </p>
    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <p>
        This week I worked towards finalizing an idea based off a dataset I found interesting and useful. I came across the Human Mortality Database which has datasets
        for over 30 countries which provides detailed mortality and population data. Based off this data, build predictive models for future life expectancy across 
        different countries. The project will focus on identifying factors influencing mortality, understanding demographic disparities, and predicting future trends 
        using statistical and machine learning models. My goal for next week is to familiarize yourself with data preprocessing and visualization tools.
